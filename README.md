## 📌 Overview  

On **10 Feb 2026**, I learned the fundamentals of **Simple Linear Regression**, one of the most important algorithms in Machine Learning and Statistics. This project demonstrates how to model the relationship between two variables using a straight line (Best Fit Line).

Simple Linear Regression helps predict a dependent variable (target) using one independent variable (feature).

## 🎯 What I Learned  

- Concept of **Supervised Learning**
- Difference between **Independent (X)** and **Dependent (y)** variables  
- Equation of Simple Linear Regression:

y = β₀ + β₁X

- Meaning of:
  - **β₀ (Intercept)** → value of y when X = 0  
  - **β₁ (Slope)** → change in y when X increases by 1 unit  
- How model finds **Best Fit Line**
- Error and Cost Function
- Model training using `LinearRegression()` from sklearn
