## 🎯 What I Learned  

- Concept of **Supervised Learning**
- Difference between **Independent (X)** and **Dependent (y)** variables  
- Equation of Simple Linear Regression:

y = β₀ + β₁X

- Meaning of:
  - **β₀ (Intercept)** → value of y when X = 0  
  - **β₁ (Slope)** → change in y when X increases by 1 unit  
- How model finds **Best Fit Line**
- Error and Cost Function
- Model training using `LinearRegression()` from sklearn
- ### 📊 Model Evaluation Learned  

- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)  
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)  
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)  
- R² Score (Model accuracy)  
- Adjusted R² Score
